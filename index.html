      <p>I'm glad you were able to make your way over to my neck of the woods. I'm a fun-loving and hard working web developer. In my spare time I like to spend time with my family, go sailing on our boat, hike, and practice photography. I have also been known to volunteer quite a bit. I have coached multiple junior level sports teams, and have even been a board member of the local PTA. Professionally, I have been a real estate photographer and videographer in the past, working in the luxury real estate market in Park City, Ut.</p>

      <p>Web developement is my current passion, so please have a look at a sample of some of my recent projects, and if you feel inclined, feel free to contact me and I'll be in touch with you shortly.</p>
